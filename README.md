# Speed21
This is a game written in Java based loosely on the classical game 21. This formed part of a university assignment completed in semester 1 2017 at RMIT.

## Running the application
This application can be ran as a standalone game or as a client/server program. Running the file "Application.java" in the app directlory will run the standalone version. Running "Server.java" followed by one or more "Client.java" instances from the same directory. 

## Notice
This application was designed and built as part of a univeristy project, as such the client server version does not have previsions to handle slow or faulty network connects as there was no requirement for it and the time frame was limited.
